# Robotic-arm
This is a project that I made for Smart Methods Company, which is a control panel for a robotic arm. 
It consists of six motors, the motor ranges from 0 to 180 degrees, and there is a button to save and another button to start the motor.
Steps for this project:
1.Structure the interface by HTML.
2.Interface formatting by CSS.
3.Create a database with SQL.
4.Connecting the database to the interface by creating a code by PHP.
